# Content Management System

Designing a Content Management System (CMS) that adheres to SOLID principles involves structuring the system into well-defined, modular components that can handle various aspects of content creation, management, and delivery. Below is a conceptual design of a CMS, along with an explanation of the design patterns used to achieve a scalable, maintainable, and extensible system.

## Key Features of a CMS

**User Management:** Handles users, roles, and permissions.
Content Management: Creation, editing, and deletion of content (e.g., articles, pages, media).
**Content Delivery:** Serving content to end-users, with support for different formats and devices.
**Versioning and Workflow:** Managing content versions and approval workflows.
**Search and Filtering:** Searching and filtering content based on various criteria.
**Notifications:** Sending alerts about content status changes (e.g., approval, publication).
**Analytics:** Tracking content performance and user interactions.
Architecture Overview
**User Management:** Manages users, roles, and permissions.
**Content Management:** Manages content creation, editing, deletion, and versioning.
**Content Delivery:** Serves content to users, possibly through APIs.
**Notification System:** Manages notifications related to content status.
**Search and Filtering:** Provides search functionality across the content repository.
**Analytics:** Tracks and reports on content performance.

## Design Patterns Used

### 1. Strategy Pattern

**Used In:** SearchService

**Purpose:** To encapsulate different search algorithms and make them interchangeable.

**Example:** The SearchService can be extended to support different search criteria without modifying the existing code. Different strategies can be applied for searching content based on title, author, or date.

### 2. Factory Pattern

**Used In:** Content Creation

**Purpose:** To create content objects (e.g., Article, Media) without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.

**Example:** A ContentFactory can create different types of content based on input parameters, allowing easy extension for new content types.

### 3. Observer Pattern

**Used In:** Notification System

**Purpose:** To notify users of changes in content status (e.g., approval, publication) without tightly coupling the notification logic to the core application.

**Example:** NotificationService can notify users via different channels like email or SMS.

### 4. Decorator Pattern

**Used In:** Content Delivery

**Purpose:** To add responsibilities to content dynamically without modifying the core content classes.

**Example:** A ContentFormatterDecorator can be used to apply different formatting (e.g., HTML, Markdown) to the content before delivery.

### 5. Repository Pattern

Used In:** Content Management

**Purpose:** To abstract data access, providing a clean separation between the content management logic and data persistence.

**Example:** An IContentRepository interface with methods like GetByTitle, Search, and AddContent allows the system to be independent of the underlying data storage.

### 6. Dependency Injection

**Used In:** Throughout the application

**Purpose:** To inject dependencies (e.g., repositories, services) into classes, promoting loose coupling and making the system more modular and testable.

**Example:** The ContentDeliveryService, SearchService, and NotificationService all depend on interfaces, which are injected into them via constructors.

## Adherence to SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class has a single responsibility, such as managing content (Content), delivering content (ContentDeliveryService), or handling user roles (Role).

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The system is open for extension but closed for modification. New content types or notification methods can be added without changing existing code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Derived classes can be substituted for their base classes. For example, Article and Media can replace Content wherever it is used.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Interfaces are small and focused. The system uses interfaces like IContentRepository, INotificationService, and IContentFactory to keep responsibilities separated and modular.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. For example, ContentDeliveryService depends on IContentRepository, not on a specific implementation.

## Summary

This design of a Content Management System follows SOLID principles and employs several design patterns to ensure that the system is modular, scalable, and maintainable. The system can easily accommodate new features, such as additional content types, new search criteria, or different notification channels, without requiring significant changes to the existing codebase. This approach makes the system robust, adaptable to changing requirements, and easy to extend
