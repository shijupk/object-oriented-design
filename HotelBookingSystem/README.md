Summary

Key Features
A robust Hotel Booking System typically includes the following features:

User Management: Registration, authentication, profile management.
Hotel Management: Adding, updating, deleting hotels and rooms, managing room availability.
Booking Management: Creating, modifying, and canceling bookings.
Payment Processing: Handling payments securely.
Search and Filtering: Searching for hotels based on various criteria like location, dates, price range, etc.
Notifications: Sending booking confirmations, reminders, and updates.
Reviews and Ratings: Allowing users to rate and review hotels.
Reporting and Analytics: Generating reports on bookings, revenue, etc.
Architecture Overview
The system is divided into several layers and components to ensure separation of concerns and adherence to SOLID principles:

Presentation Layer: Handles user interactions (e.g., Controllers in MVC).
Application Layer: Contains business logic (e.g., Services).
Domain Layer: Represents business entities and rules (e.g., Entities, Value Objects).
Infrastructure Layer: Deals with data persistence, external services, etc. (e.g., Repositories, Email Services).
Utilities/Helpers: Common functionalities like logging, encryption, etc.

Summary
Designing a Hotel Booking System with SOLID principles involves:

Separation of Concerns: Dividing the system into distinct layers and components, each handling specific responsibilities.
Use of Design Patterns: Leveraging patterns like Repository, Factory, Strategy, Observer, Decorator, Singleton, and Dependency Injection to enhance flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.
Adherence to SOLID: Ensuring that the system is modular, extensible, and easy to understand and modify.
This approach results in a robust system that can evolve with changing requirements, integrates new features seamlessly, and remains maintainable over time.
