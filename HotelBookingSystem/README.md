# Hotel Booking System

## Key Features

A robust Hotel Booking System typically includes the following features:

**User Management:** Registration, authentication, profile management.
**Hotel Management:** Adding, updating, deleting hotels and rooms, managing room availability.
**Booking Management:** Creating, modifying, and canceling bookings.
**Payment Processing:** Handling payments securely.
**Search and Filtering:** Searching for hotels based on various criteria like location, dates, price range, etc.
**Notifications:** Sending booking confirmations, reminders, and updates.
**Reviews and Ratings:** Allowing users to rate and review hotels.
**Reporting and Analytics:** Generating reports on bookings, revenue, etc.

## Architecture Overview

The system is divided into several layers and components to ensure separation of concerns and adherence to SOLID principles:

**Presentation Layer:** Handles user interactions (e.g., Controllers in MVC).
**Application Layer:** Contains business logic (e.g., Services).
Domain Layer: Represents business entities and rules (e.g., Entities, Value Objects).
**Infrastructure Layer:** Deals with data persistence, external services, etc. (e.g., Repositories, Email Services).
**Utilities/Helpers:** Common functionalities like logging, encryption, etc.


## Design Patterns Used
### 1. Strategy Pattern
Used In: Payment Processing

**Purpose:** To define a family of algorithms (payment methods), encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

**Example:** The IPaymentMethod interface allows different payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal) to be used interchangeably without modifying the PaymentService class.

### 2. Factory Pattern
**Used In:** Room Creation

**Purpose:** To create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.

**Example:** A RoomFactory could be used to create different types of rooms based on input parameters, allowing easy extension for new room types.

### 3. Observer Pattern
**Used In:** Notification System

**Purpose:** To notify customers of changes in reservation status (e.g., confirmation, cancellation) without tightly coupling the notification logic to the reservation system.

**Example:** The NotificationService can notify customers via different channels (e.g., email, SMS) when their reservation status changes.

### 4. Decorator Pattern
**Used In:** Reporting

**Purpose:** To add responsibilities to objects dynamically.

**Example:** A ReservationReportDecorator could be used to add additional information (e.g., revenue generated) to the report without modifying the existing ReservationReport class.

### 5. Singleton Pattern
**Used In:** Room Management

**Purpose:** To ensure that only one instance of a class (e.g., RoomManager) exists in the system.

**Example:** A RoomManager class could be implemented as a singleton to ensure consistent management of room availability and assignments across the system.

## Adherence to SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

Each class has a single responsibility. For example, Room manages room availability, Reservation handles reservation details, and PaymentService manages payments.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

The system is open for extension but closed for modification. For example, new payment methods can be added by implementing IPaymentMethod without modifying existing code.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Derived classes can be substituted for their base classes. For example, CreditCardPayment can replace IPaymentMethod in the PaymentService class.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

Interfaces are small and focused. For example, the IPaymentMethod interface

## Summary

Designing a Hotel Booking System with SOLID principles involves:

**Separation of Concerns:** Dividing the system into distinct layers and components, each handling specific responsibilities.
**Use of Design Patterns:** Leveraging patterns like Repository, Factory, Strategy, Observer, Decorator, Singleton, and Dependency Injection to enhance flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.
**Adherence to SOLID:** Ensuring that the system is modular, extensible, and easy to understand and modify.

This approach results in a robust system that can evolve with changing requirements, integrates new features seamlessly, and remains maintainable over time.
