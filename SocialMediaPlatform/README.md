# Social Media Platform

Designing a Social Media Platform while adhering to the SOLID principles involves creating a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture. Below is a conceptual design, followed by an explanation of the design patterns used to achieve these goals.

## Key Features of the Social Media Platform

**User Management:** Registration, authentication, profile management.

**Content Management:** Posting, editing, deleting, and viewing posts (text, images, videos).

**Interaction:** Liking, commenting, sharing posts.

**Feed Management:** Displaying posts in a user’s feed, including filtering and sorting.

**Notifications:** Alerting users about new likes, comments, followers, etc.

## Class Diagram Overview

**User:** Represents a user in the system.

**Post:** Represents a post made by a user.

**Comment:** Represents a comment on a post.

**Like:** Represents a like on a post.

**Feed:** Represents a user’s feed, which aggregates posts.

**Notification:** Manages notifications for users.

**SocialMediaPlatform:** Orchestrates the overall functionality of the platform.

## Adherence to SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class has a single responsibility, e.g., User handles user-specific actions, Post manages post-specific logic, Feed handles feed generation, and Notification manages notifications.

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The system is open for extension but closed for modification. For example, you can introduce new feed strategies or notification methods without modifying existing classes.

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Classes that implement an interface can be substituted for each other without affecting the program's correctness. For instance, different implementations of IFeedStrategy can be used interchangeably.

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Interfaces are small and focused, ensuring that classes don't implement methods they don't need. For example, IUserRepository, INotificationService, and IFeedStrategy each focus on a specific part of the system.

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules like SocialMediaPlatform depend on abstractions (IUserRepository, IFeedStrategy, INotificationService), not on concrete implementations.

### Design Patterns Used

**1. Strategy Pattern:**   Feed Management

The Feed class uses the Strategy pattern to allow different algorithms for generating a user's feed (e.g., chronological, based on engagement, etc.). By injecting different IFeedStrategy implementations, you can easily switch or extend feed generation logic without altering the Feed class.

**2. Observer Pattern:** Notification System

The Notification class uses the Observer pattern to notify users about events such as new posts, comments, likes, etc. This allows the platform to easily manage and extend notifications as new types of interactions are introduced.

**4. Repository Pattern:** User Management

The IUserRepository interface abstracts the data layer, providing a clean separation between business logic and data access. This makes the system easier to maintain and test.

**5. Factory Pattern:** Post Creation

The Factory pattern can be applied to create different types of posts (e.g., text, image, video). This helps in managing the creation logic and ensures that the Post class is not overloaded with creation logic.

**6. Dependency Injection:** SocialMediaPlatform

The SocialMediaPlatform class utilizes Dependency Injection (DI) to inject its dependencies (IUserRepository, IFeedStrategy, INotificationService). This promotes loose coupling and makes the system more flexible and testable.

## Summary

This design of a Social Media Platform is modular, extensible, and adheres to SOLID principles. The use of design patterns like Strategy, Observer, Repository, Factory, and Dependency Injection ensures that the system is easy to maintain, test, and extend as new features or requirements emerge. This approach promotes code that is clean, manageable, and scalable, making it well-suited for a complex application like
