# Black Jack Card Game

Designing a Black Jack game in C# that adheres to SOLID principles involves structuring the code so that it's modular, maintainable, and flexible. Below is a high-level approach to implementing this, following each of the SOLID principles:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class should have one responsibility or reason to change. In a Black Jack game, you could identify several responsibilities:

Card: Represents a playing card.
Deck: Manages the collection of cards and deals them.
Hand: Represents a player's or dealer's collection of cards.
Player: Encapsulates the behavior and state of a player (including the dealer).
Game: Manages the overall flow of the game.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. To achieve this, you can design your classes with interfaces or base classes that can be extended without altering existing code.

ICard, IDeck, IHand, IPlayer, IGame: Define interfaces that each of these entities implement.
Deck: You can extend the Deck class to support multiple deck games or custom card sets without changing the original Deck class.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes without altering the correctness of the program. Ensure that any subclass can replace its parent class without unexpected behaviors.

If you create a CheatingDeck class (for testing purposes) that inherits from Deck, it should be able to be used wherever a Deck is expected without breaking the game logic.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Break down your interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

Instead of having a massive IGame interface, you might have smaller interfaces like IPlayable, IBettable, and IScorable, which would be implemented by the Game class.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but rather on abstractions. Similarly, abstractions should not depend on details.

Use dependency injection to pass in instances of IDeck, IPlayer, etc., to the Game class, rather than having the Game class instantiate these objects directly.

Key Points:
SRP: Each class has a single responsibility, making the code easier to maintain.
OCP: You can add new types of players or decks without modifying existing code.
LSP: Derived classes can replace base classes without altering the game’s behavior.
ISP: Smaller, more focused interfaces prevent the need to implement unnecessary methods.
DIP: High-level Game logic depends on abstractions like IDeck and IPlayer, allowing for flexible implementations.
This design can be further refined based on additional requirements, such as betting systems, different types of games, or advanced AI for players.
