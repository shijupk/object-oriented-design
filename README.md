# Object Oriented Design Problem

Object-oriented design (OOD) problems are a common feature in technical interviews, especially for roles that require strong design and architecture skills. These problems test your ability to apply OOP principles, design patterns, and SOLID principles to create flexible, maintainable, and scalable software systems. Here are some of the most popular OOD problems that are frequently asked in interviews:

## 1. Design a Parking Lot System

**Problem Statement:** Design a parking lot with multiple levels, different sizes of parking spots (compact, large, motorcycle), and different types of vehicles (car, truck, motorcycle). The system should support parking a vehicle, removing a vehicle, and calculating parking fees.
**Key Concepts:** Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, SOLID principles, design patterns like Factory and Strategy.

## 2. Design an Elevator System

**Problem Statement:** Design an elevator system for a building with multiple floors and elevators. The system should handle requests from both inside the elevator (to go to a specific floor) and from floors (to call the elevator up or down).
**Key Concepts:** State management, concurrency, priority queues, SOLID principles, design patterns like Observer and Command.

## 3. Design a Library Management System

**Problem Statement:** Design a system to manage a library's inventory of books, users (members), and borrowing/lending operations. It should handle tasks like searching for a book, checking out a book, returning a book, and calculating fines.
**Key Concepts:** Encapsulation, data modeling, SOLID principles, relationships (composition and aggregation), design patterns like Singleton and Factory.

## 4. Design an Online Shopping System (E-commerce)

**Problem Statement:** Design an online shopping platform where users can browse products, add them to a cart, place orders, make payments, and track orders. The system should also handle inventory management and user accounts.
**Key Concepts:** Object modeling, encapsulation, SOLID principles, design patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller), Factory, and Strategy.

## 5. Design a Movie Ticket Booking System

**Problem Statement:** Design a system for booking movie tickets. It should allow users to search for movies, view showtimes, select seats, book tickets, and make payments. The system should handle different types of seating arrangements (e.g., regular, VIP).
**Key Concepts:** Object modeling, state management, SOLID principles, design patterns like Factory, and Observer.

## 6. Design a Social Media Platform

**Problem Statement:** Design a social media platform where users can create profiles, post updates, follow other users, like/comment on posts, and view a feed of updates from people they follow.
**Key Concepts:** Data modeling, relationships, SOLID principles, design patterns like Observer and Strategy, scalability considerations.

## 7. Design a File System

**Problem Statement:** Design a basic file system where files and directories are represented as objects. The system should support operations like creating, deleting, and moving files and directories, as well as navigating through the directory structure.
****Key Concepts:**** Inheritance, polymorphism, composition, SOLID principles, design patterns like Composite and Iterator.

## 8. Design a Hotel Booking System

**Problem Statement:** Design a hotel booking system that allows users to search for hotels, view room availability, make bookings, and manage their reservations. The system should also handle cancellations and payments.
**Key Concepts:** Object modeling, state management, SOLID principles, design patterns like Factory and Strategy.

## 9. Design a Chess Game

**Problem Statement:** Design a chess game where two players can play against each other. The system should manage the state of the game, validate moves, and determine the winner.
**Key Concepts:** Object modeling, inheritance, encapsulation, SOLID principles, design patterns like State and Strategy.

## 10. Design a Ride-Sharing Service (e.g., Uber, Lyft)

**Problem Statement:** Design a ride-sharing service where users can request rides, drivers can accept rides, and the system matches riders with drivers based on their locations. The system should also handle payments and ratings.

**Key Concepts:** Object modeling, state management, SOLID principles, design patterns like Observer and Strategy, scalability considerations.

## 11. Design a Content Management System (CMS)

**Problem Statement:** Design a content management system that allows users to create, edit, publish, and manage digital content. The system should support different types of content (e.g., articles, images, videos) and user roles (e.g., admin, editor, viewer).
**Key Concepts:** Object modeling, encapsulation, SOLID principles, design patterns like Factory and Strategy, role-based access control.

## 15. Design a Banking System

**Problem Statement:** Design a banking system that supports customer accounts, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and transaction history. The system should also handle security features like authentication and fraud detection.
**Key Concepts:** Data modeling, state management, SOLID principles, design patterns like Singleton and Observer, security considerations.
These problems often require a solid understanding of OOP principles and the ability to create a design that is both flexible and maintainable.
