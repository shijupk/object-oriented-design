Designing a Banking System that adheres to the SOLID principles involves structuring the system into modular, maintainable components that handle various aspects of banking operations such as account management, transaction processing, user management, and security. Below is a conceptual design of such a system, including an explanation of the design patterns used to achieve a scalable, maintainable, and extensible system.

Key Features of a Banking System
User Management: Handles customer registration, authentication, and profile management.
Account Management: Manages different types of bank accounts (e.g., savings, checking).
Transaction Management: Processes transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
Loan Management: Manages loan applications, approvals, and repayments.
Notification System: Sends notifications about account activities and important updates.
Security: Ensures the system's security through authentication, authorization, and encryption.
Reporting: Generates reports on account activities, transactions, and balances.
Architecture Overview
User Management: Manages customers and their accounts.
Account Management: Manages different types of accounts and their operations.
Transaction Management: Manages the lifecycle of transactions.
Loan Management: Handles loan applications and repayments.
Notification System: Manages notifications to customers.
Security: Handles user authentication and authorization.
Reporting: Generates reports for account activities and transactions.
Design Patterns Used
1. Strategy Pattern
Used In: Notification System, Payment Processing

Purpose: To define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

Example: The INotificationService interface allows different notification methods (e.g., email, SMS) to be used interchangeably.

2. Factory Pattern
Used In: Account Creation, Loan Creation

Purpose: To create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.

Example: The system can use a factory pattern to create different types of accounts or loans based
